A pre-trained feature extraction auto-encoder model with a joint optimization scheme is introduced to achieve robust performance on widely distributed and unrefined data. This approach shows promise in detecting ASD in infants compared to using raw datasets directly.\n\n2. **Utilization of Vocal Characteristics in ASD Diagnosis**: The research highlights the significance of vocal characteristics as a prominent area for observing infants' behavior related to ASD. It mentions the abnormal prosody and atypical vocal patterns observed in children with ASD, such as flat intonation, atypical pitch, and control volume. The study explores engineering approaches to discriminate between ASD and typically developing (TD) children based on vocal acoustic features.\n\n3. **Machine Learning Techniques for ASD Classification**: The document outlines the application of various machine learning techniques, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), for classifying children with ASD. These techniques utilize distinct vocal characteristics and have shown effective accuracy in distinguishing between ASD and TD children.\n\n4. **Geneva Minimalist Acoustic Parameter Set (eGeMAPS) for Speech Feature Extraction**: The study employs an extended version of the Geneva Minimalist Acoustic Parameter Set (eGeMAPS) for extracting speech features. This feature set is used in conjunction with a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) model to differentiate between ASD and TD children, demonstrating a 75% accuracy in classifying subjects' utterances.\n\n5. **Challenges and Future Directions in ASD Diagnosis**: The document acknowledges the difficulties in characterizing data, complex analysis, and the lack of arranged data, which leads to low accessibility to diagnosis that needs secure anonymity. It suggests focusing on increasing the reliability of the proposed methods by adding more infant speech data, refining acoustic features, and exploring deeper and up-to-date model structures for better ASD diagnosis in future work.\n\nThese findings underscore the potential of multimodal and multi-modular AI approaches in enhancing the early detection and diagnosis of ASD in young children, highlighting the importance of vocal characteristics, machine learning techniques, and the need for further research to overcome existing challenges.\n=========================================\n\nQuery 2 is: What is Autism Spectrum Disorder, how it is caysed?\nAnswer is as follows:\n\nBased on the provided document, here are the top 5 most similar relevant research findings on Autism, Therapy, and Intervention:\n\n1. **Early Detection and Intervention**: The document highlights the importance of early detection of ASD characteristics as a key point in current ASD research. Various instruments for discriminating ASD have been developed, with a commonly accepted gold standard scheme being behavioral assessment. However, these assessments suffer from stability issues in ASD diagnosis results, access issues, and interpretation bias by professionals. This underscores the need for early clinical intervention, which has been shown to improve social abilities in people with ASD.\n\n2. **Automated Diagnostic Methods**: There's a significant focus on developing automated diagnostic methods to acquire objective measurements of autism. These methods span multiple fields of research, including genetic determinants, analysis of brain imaging, and physiological approaches.
